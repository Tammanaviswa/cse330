/* The Sieve of Atkin is an algorithm used for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It is an optimization over the simpler Sieve of Eratosthenes. The Sieve of Atkin is more complex but faster for larger numbers. The time complexity of the Sieve of Atkin is generally considered to be \(O(N/\log \log N)\), making it more efficient for larger inputs compared to the \(O(N \log \log N)\) complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Here is a basic implementation of the Sieve of Atkin in C++:

1. **Include Necessary Headers:** Use `<iostream>`, `<vector>`.
2. **Read User Input:** Get the limit up to which prime numbers need to be found.
3. **Sieve Algorithm:**
    - Initialize a boolean array with `false` values.
    - Put in place the various Atkin conditions to flip the boolean values for potential primes.
    - Handle multiples of squares of primes.
4. **Print Prime Numbers:** Starting from 2, print numbers that have been marked as prime.

            if (n <= limit && (n % 12 == 1 || n % 12 == 5)) sieve[n] ^= true;

            n = (3 * x * x) + (y * y);
            if (n <= limit && n % 12 == 7) sieve[n] ^= true;

            n = (3 * x * x) - (y * y);

/*
``

This implementation:
- Uses a boolean vector to mark the primes.
- Applies the Atkin conditions to identify potential primes.
- Eliminates squares of primes.
- Finally, prints out the primes up to the given limit. 

Remember, the Sieve of Atkin is more complex and can be harder to understand than simpler prime sieving methods, but it offers better performance for larger limits.
