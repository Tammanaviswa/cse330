/*The binomial coefficient, commonly known as "n choose k" and represented as \( \binom{n}{k} \), is a fundamental concept in combinatorics. It represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without considering the order. A dynamic programming approach can efficiently compute binomial coefficients.

This approach has a time complexity of \( O(n \times k) \) and a space complexity of \( O(n \times k) \).

Here's how you can implement the calculation of binomial coefficients in C++:

1. **Include Necessary Headers:** Use `<iostream>` and `<vector>`.
2. **Read User Input:** Get the values of \( n \) and \( k \) from the user.
3. **Dynamic Programming Solution:**
   - Create a two-dimensional array to store intermediate results.
   - Use the property that \( \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} \).
4. **Return the Result:** The value \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the final result.

Here's the implementation:

```cpp*/
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int binomialCoefficient(int n, int k) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= min(i, k); j++) {
            if (j == 0 || j == i) {
                dp[i][j] = 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][k];
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cout << "Enter n (total number of items): ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Enter k (number of items to choose): ";
    cin >> k;

    cout << "Binomial Coefficient (" << n << " choose " << k << "): " << binomialCoefficient(n, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
/*
```

In this code:
- The `binomialCoefficient` function computes the binomial coefficient using dynamic programming.
- A 2D vector `dp` is used to store the binomial coefficients for different values of \( n \) and \( k \).
- The `main` function takes the values of \( n \) and \( k \) from the user and calls `binomialCoefficient` to calculate and print the result.*/
