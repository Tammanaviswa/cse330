Sorting strings in C++ can be efficiently done using the standard sort algorithm provided by the C++ Standard Library, which typically implements an optimized version of QuickSort known as Introsort. This algorithm has an average and worst-case time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements (in this case, strings) to be sorted.

The sorting of strings will be based on lexicographical order, which is essentially dictionary order. 

Here's how you can implement string sorting in C++:

1. **Include Necessary Headers:** Use `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, and `<algorithm>`.
2. **Read User Input:** Get the number of strings and then the strings themselves from the user.
3. **Sort the Strings:**
   - Use the `std::sort` function from the `<algorithm>` header.
4. **Print the Sorted Strings:**

Here's the implementation:

```cpp
*/
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of strings: ";
    cin >> n;

    vector<string> strings(n);
    cout << "Enter the strings:" << endl;
    cin.ignore();  // To ignore the newline character after reading n

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        getline(cin, strings[i]);
    }

    sort(strings.begin(), strings.end());

    cout << "Sorted strings:" << endl;
    for (const string& str : strings) {
        cout << str << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
/*
```

In this code:
- The `main` function takes the number of strings and the strings themselves as input.
- It uses `std::sort` to sort the strings in lexicographical order.
- Finally, it prints out the sorted list of strings. 
*/
The `std::sort` function in C++ is a highly optimized sorting algorithm and works well for sorting a wide range of data types, including strings.
